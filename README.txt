This project will take an image of a graph as a PNG file, and locate the nodes and edges.

It contains the following classes:
main.py - The main loop that starts our program
gui.py - The GUI that shows our input and the graph structure we have identified
learner.py - The functions for locating nodes and edges
graph.py - A class for storing graphs (nodes, edges, and locations)
